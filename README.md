# Applying Machine Learning in CERN experiments

Here I have done a chain of mini-projects to infer from the data that was generated by CERN. I have used several machine learning algorithms depending upon the type of data and the type of inference we want to make.

Each of the project has been explained with a seperate **readme** and the proper visualization and everything is done the jupyter notebooks to understand the essence of what needs to  be done.
